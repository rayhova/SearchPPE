Easily select CSS Ready Classes for your fields within Gravity Forms

== Description ==

> This plugin is an add-on for the amazing Gravity Forms Plugin. 
Special thanks to [Brad Vincent](https://profiles.wordpress.org/bradvin/) and [Bryan Willis](https://github.com/bryanwillis) for developing the first and revised version of this plugin. 

Gravity Forms has CSS Ready Classes to style your form fields. Using these classes, you can easily create more advanced layouts for the fields in your forms. Excellent idea, however, the problem is you always need to remember what the exact class name is. Now with this CSS Ready Classes selector, you donâ€™t need to remember. Simply click on a button to launch the pop-up and choose the class you want to add.

= Features =
* Convenient button added under the advanced tab next to the CSS Class field
* Clean and simple pop-up that lists all the CSS Ready Classes
* Add more than one CSS Ready Class
* Double-click a CSS Ready Class to add it and auto-close the popup
* Also 4 columns supported

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` folder
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Make sure you also have Gravity Forms activated.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin rely on anything? =
Yes, you need to install the [Gravity Forms Plugin](http://www.gravityforms.com/) for this plugin to work. And it needs to be at least v1.5.

= How to add custom CSS buttons? =
You can add your own CSS to the CSS Selector easily in your functions.php file. Just add the following example code there. It adds quick buttons and an accordion on top of the modal. That way you can put easily your own CSS in the layout you want.

`// Add custom css: quick buttons and accordion at the top of the GravityWP - CSS Selector modal
function my_custom_gwp_css_selector_add_css() {
    $html .= "<div class='gwp_quick_links'>
	<a class='gwp_css_link' href='#' rel='your_custom_css_class' title='Adds your_custom_css_class to the CSS field'>Custom css</a>
	<a class='gwp_css_link' href='#' rel='your_custom_css_class_2' title='Adds your_custom_css_class_2 to the CSS field'>2nd custom css</a></div>
	<li>
	<a class='gwp_css_acc_link' href='#'>Custom CSS</a>
	<div class='gwp_css_accordian'>
	<a class='gwp_css_link' href='#' rel='your_custom_css_class' title='Adds your_custom_css_class to the CSS field'>Custom css</a>
	<a class='gwp_css_link' href='#' rel='your_custom_css_class_2' title='Adds your_custom_css_class_2 to the CSS field'>2nd custom css</a>
	</div>
	</li>";
    return $html;
}
add_filter( 'gwp_css_selector_add_custom_css', 'my_custom_gwp_css_selector_add_css' );`
